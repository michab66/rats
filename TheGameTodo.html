<UL>
	<LI><P>Does not work with InternetExplorer because the number of
	images created exceeds some MS class library defined limit.  This
	results in a 'SecurityException: Too many images' thrown.  Since the
	Java console is normally neither visible nor active in a normal IE
	setup this looks like a silent fail.  No workaround at the moment
	exists,  we have to reduce the number of images created which is not
	that easy.</P>
	<LI><P>On Java 2 (formerly Java 1.2):  Either we have some problem
	with the CropImageFilter or Sun has.  The problem is that the
	Picture strips are not cropped as expected, but sometimes we get a
	set of cropped images where every image contains the first picture. 
	At the moment this is fixed in
	PictureStrip.java#initFromVerticalImage, where the crop size is
	reduced by one pixel, which leads to small display errors, but works
	on MS and Sun appletviewers.  The initFromHorizontalImage method is
	not touched and should contain just the same problem.</P>
	<LI><P>A number of deprecated warnings arise when compiling this
	thing.  Remove as much as possible without compromising Java 1.0
	compatibility...</P>
	<LI><P>After having a look into the code I have the impression, that
	this needs a general rework for better reusability.  Too many
	classes need to be subclassed to get something working.  We also
	need to think about the current animation mode &#150; box based
	image animation &#150; maybe some coordinate based scheme with
	movement vectors would be better and more universally and better
	suite for the poor soul bein responsible creating the game
	graphics...</P>
